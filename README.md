For application development we used the following technologies:

- Kotlin
- SpringBoot

You can download the application on the following link:
> `http://147.91.204.115:10069/`  
> Username: `admin`  
> Password: `Po1ntCheck`


Test user accounts:
> Username: `user1`
> Password: `testuser1`

> Username: `user2`
> Password: `testuser2`


### Docker
For simple running application on a server, you should move to the same folder built jar file, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and default profile picture.  
After that, you can just type the following command in terminal:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
